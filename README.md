# EAGLE

Implement of EAGLE (agglomerativE hierarchicAl clusterinG based on maximaL cliquE) algorithm for network community detection proposed in paper [Detect overlapping and hierarchical community structure in networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3093.pdf) by Huawei Shen et al..

## Requirements

```text
matplotlib==3.5.1
networkx==2.6.3
numpy==1.22.2
```

To install the requirements:

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example


Here we reproduce Figure 1(d) from the paper. Example codes can be found in *example.py* which detected three overlapped communities in the original network. 

To run the example code, run *example.py*:

```text
python example.py
```

![Figure 1(d)](./media/fig_1d.png) 

The figure below shows the detected community structure of the network in Figure 1(d) from the paper by *example.py* and the curve of EQ corresponding to each cover
of the network when the dendrogram is cut at different layer.
